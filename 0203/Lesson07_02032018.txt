# P7.7 
Write a program that reads a sequence of integers into an array and that computes the alternating sum of all elements in the array. For example, if the program is executed with the input data1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11then it computes1 − 4 + 9 − 16 + 9 − 7 + 4 − 9 + 11 = −2

#(Assign grades) 
Write a program that reads student scores, gets the best score, and then assigns grades based on the following scheme:Grade is A if score is >= best - 10Grade is B if score is >= best - 20;Grade is C if score is >= best - 30;Grade is D if score is >= best - 40;Grade is F otherwise.The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, then prompts the user to enter all of the scores, and concludes by displaying the grades. Here is a sample run:Enter the number of students: 4Enter 4 scores: 40 55 70 58Student 0 score is 40 and grade is CStudent 1 score is 55 and grade is BStudent 2 score is 70 and grade is AStudent 3 score is 58 and grade is B

#(Reverse the numbers entered) 
Write a program that reads ten integers and displays them in the reverse of the order in which they were read.
