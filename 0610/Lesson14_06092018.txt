R5.1 What is the value of each variable after the if statement?
a. int n = 1; int k = 2; int r = n; if (k < n) r = k;
b. int n = 1; int k = 2; int r; if (n < k) r = k; else r = k + n;
c. int n = 1; int k = 2; int r = k; if (r < k) n = r; else k = n;
d. int n = 1; int k = 2; int r = 3; if (r < n + k) r = 2 * n; else k = 2 * r;
A:
a. n:1 k:2 r:2
b. n:1 k:2 r:1
c. n:1 k:1 r:2
d. n:1 k:6 r:3

R5.2 Find the errors in the following if statements.
a. if (1 + x > Math.pow(x, Math.sqrt(2)) y = y + x;
b. if (x = 1) y++; else if (x = 2) y = y + 2;
c. int x = Integer.parseInt(input);
if (x != null) y = y + x;

R5.3 Find the error in the following if statement that is intended to select a language
from a given country and state/province.
language = "English";
if (country.equals("Canada"))
if (stateOrProvince.equals("Quebec")) language = "French";

language = "Chinese";
A: See the Indentation in Eclipse

R5.4 Find the errors in the following if statements.
a. if (x && y == 0) { x = 1; y = 1; }
b. if (1 <= x <= 10)
System.out.println(x);
c. if (!s.equals("nickels") || !s.equals("pennies")
|| !s.equals("dimes") || !s.equals("quarters"))
System.out.print("Input error!");
d. if (input.equalsIgnoreCase("N") || "NO")
return;

R5.5 Explain the following terms, and give an example for each construct:
a. Expression
A syntactical construct that is made up of constants, variables, method calls, and operators combining them.
b. Condition
c. Statement
A syntactical unit in a program. In Java a statement is either a simple statement, a compound statement, or a block.
d. Simple statement
A statement consisting of a single expression
e. Compound statement
A statement such as if or while that is made up of several parts such as a condition and a body.
f. Block
A group of statements bracketed by{}
For example, (a * 2) is an expression. b + (a * 2); is a statement.
if statement has two parts: a condition and a body. If the condition is true, the body of the statement is executed.

nested if statements. Give an example for each.

R5.10 Each square on a chess board can be described by a letter and number, such as g5 in
this example:
The following pseudocode describes an algorithm that determines whether a square
with a given letter and number is dark (black) or light (white).
If the letter is an a, c, e, or g
If the number is odd
color = "black"
Else
color = "white"
Else
If the number is even
color = "black"
Else
color = "white"
Using the procedure in Productivity Hint 5.2 on page 192, trace this pseudocode
with input g5.

R5.11 Give a set of four test cases for the algorithm of Exercise R5.10 that covers all
branches.
A: See R5_10 in Eclipse

R5.12 In a scheduling program, we want to check whether two appointments overlap. For
simplicity, appointments start at a full hour, and we use military time (with hours 0–
24). The following pseudocode describes an algorithm that determines whether the
appointment with start time start1 and end time end1 overlaps with the appointment
with start time start2 and end time end2.
If start1 > start2
s = start1
Else
s = start2
If end1 < end2
e = endl
Else
e = end2
If s < e
The appointments overlap.
Else
The appointments don’t overlap.
Trace this algorithm with an appointment from 10–12 and one from 11–13, then
with an appointment from 10–11 and one from 12–13.

R5.13 Write pseudocode for a program that prompts the user for a month and day and
prints out whether it is one of the following four holidays:
• New Year’s Day (January 1)
• Independence Day (July 4)
• Veterans Day (November 11)
• Christmas Day (December 25)

R5.14 True or false? A && B is the same as B && A for any Boolean conditions A and B.

R5.15 Explain the difference between
s = 0;
if (x > 0) s++;
if (y > 0) s++;
and
s = 0;
if (x > 0) s++;
else if (y > 0) s++;

R5.16 Use de Morgan’s law to simplify the following Boolean expressions.
a. !(x > 0 && y > 0)
b. !(x != 0 || y != 0)
c. !(country.equals("US") && !state.equals("HI")
&& !state.equals("AK"))
d. !(x % 4 != 0 || !(x % 100 == 0 && x % 400 == 0))

R5.17 Make up another Java code example that shows the dangling else problem, using
the following statement: A student with a GPA of at least 1.5, but less than 2, is on
probation; with less than 1.5, the student is failing.
A: see p.191 and Eclipse

R5.18 Explain the difference between the == operator and the equals method when comparing
strings.

R5.19 Explain the difference between the tests
r == s
and
r.equals(s)
where both r and s are of type Rectangle.
A: p.181
If you compare two object references with the == operator, you test whether the references
refer to the same object.
use the equals method to test whether two rectangles have the same contents

R5.20 What is wrong with this test to see whether r is null? What happens when this code
runs?
Rectangle r;
. . .
if (r.equals(null))
r = new Rectangle(5, 10, 20, 30);

R5.21 Explain how the lexicographic ordering of strings differs from the ordering of
words in a dictionary or telephone book. Hint: Consider strings, such as IBM,
wiley.com, Century 21, While-U-Wait, and 7-11.
A: p.179
Java is case sensitive and sorts characters by putting numbers first, then uppercase characters, then lowercase characters. For example, 1 comes before B, which comes before a. The space character comes before all other characters.

R5.22 Write Java code to test whether two objects of type Line2D.Double represent the same
line when displayed on the graphics screen. Do not use a.equals(b).
Line2D.Double a;
Line2D.Double b;
if (your condition goes here)
g2.drawString("They look the same!", x, y);
Hint: If p and q are points, then Line2D.Double(p, q) and Line2D.Double(q, p) look the
same.

R5.23 Explain why it is more difficult to compare floating-point numbers than integers.
Write Java code to test whether an integer n equals 10 and whether a floating-point
number x is approximately equal to 10.
A: p.177

R5.24 Consider the following test to see whether a point falls inside a rectangle.
Point2D.Double p = . . .
Rectangle r = . . .
boolean xInside = false;
if (r.getX() <= p.getX() && p.getX() <= r.getX() + r.getWidth())
xInside = true;
boolean yInside = false;
if (r.getY() <= p.getY() && p.getY() <= r.getY() + r.getHeight())
yInside = true;
if (xInside && yInside)
g2.drawString("p is inside the rectangle.",
p.getX(), p.getY());
Rewrite this code to eliminate the explicit true and false values, by setting xInside
and yInside to the values of Boolean expressions.

R5.25 Give a set of test cases for the earthquake program in Section 5.3.1. Ensure coverage
of all branches.
A: p.185

R5.26 Give an example of a boundary test case for the earthquake program in Section
5.3.1. What result do you expect?
