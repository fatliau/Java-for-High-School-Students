#Object-oriented design refers to the art of decomposing an application into some number of objects. The goal is to break the problem down into a number of smaller problems that are simpler and easier to handle.

#pass by objects:
Integer i=1;
i= i + 1;
is operating on an Integer, not an int. It does the following:
1.unbox i to an int value
2.add 1 to that value
3.box the result into another Integer object
4.assign the resulting Integer to i (thus changing what object i references)
