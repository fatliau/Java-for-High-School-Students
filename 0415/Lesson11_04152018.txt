R2.1 Explain the difference between an object and an object reference.

A: Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(3,4);

R2.2 Explain the difference between an object and an object variable.

A: rect.length = 6;

R2.3 Explain the difference between an object and a class.

R2.4 Give the Java code for constructing an object of class Rectangle, and for declaring an
object variable of class Rectangle.

R2.5 Explain the difference between the = symbol in Java and in mathematics.

R2.6 Give Java code for objects with the following descriptions:
a. A rectangle with center (100, 100) and all side lengths equal to 50
b. A string with the contents “Hello, Dave”
Create objects, not object variables.

A: Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(50,50,100,100);
String str = new String(“Hello, Dave”);

R2.7 Repeat Exercise R2.6, but now declare object variables that are initialized with the
required objects.

R2.8 Write a Java statement to initialize a variable square with a rectangle object whose
top left corner is (10, 20) and whose sides all have length 40. Then write a statement
that replaces square with a rectangle of the same size and top left corner (20, 20).

A: Rectangle square = new Rectangle(40,40,10,20);
square = new Rectangle(40,40,20,20);

R2.9 Write Java statements that initialize two variables square1 and square2 to refer to the
same square with center (20, 20) and side length 40.

R2.10 Write Java statements that initialize a string message with "Hello" and then change it
to "HELLO". Use the toUpperCase method.

A:		String hello = new String("hello");
		System.out.println(hello);
		hello = hello.toUpperCase();
		System.out.println(hello);


R2.11 Write Java statements that initialize a string message with "Hello" and then change it
to "hello". Use the replace method.

R2.12 Find the errors in the following statements:
a. Rectangle r = (5, 10, 15, 20);
A: Rectangle r = new Rectangle(5, 10, 15, 20);

b. double width = Rectangle(5, 10, 15, 20).getWidth();
A: double width = new Rectangle(5, 10, 15, 20).getWidth();

c. Rectangle r;
r.translate(15, 25);
A:		Rectangle r = new Rectangle(5,10,15,20);
		r.translate(15, 25);

d. r = new Rectangle();
r.translate("far, far away!");

R2.13 Name two accessor methods and two mutator methods of the Rectangle class.

R2.14 Look into the API documentation of the Rectangle class and locate the method
void add(int newx, int newy)
Read through the method documentation. Then determine the result of the following
statements:
Rectangle box = new Rectangle(5, 10, 20, 30);
box.add(0, 0);
If you are not sure, write a small test program.
