R4.1 Write the following mathematical expressions in Java.
A:see codes

R4.2 Write the following Java expressions in mathematical notation.
a. dm = m * (Math.sqrt(1 + v / c) / (Math.sqrt(1 - v / c) - 1));
b. volume = Math.PI * r * r * h;
c. volume = 4 * Math.PI * Math.pow(r, 3) / 3;
d. p = Math.atan2(z, Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y));

R4.3 What is wrong with this version of the quadratic formula?
x1 = (-b - Math.sqrt(b * b - 4 * a * c)) / 2 * a;
x2 = (-b + Math.sqrt(b * b - 4 * a * c)) / 2 * a;
A:Use parentheses

R4.4 Give an example of integer overflow. Would the same example work correctly if
you used floating-point?

R4.5 Give an example of a floating-point roundoff error. Would the same example work
correctly if you used integers and switched to a sufficiently small unit, such as cents
instead of dollars, so that the values donâ€™t have a fractional part?
A:see codes from text book

R4.6 Consider the following code:
CashRegister register = new CashRegister();
register.recordPurchase(19.93);
register.enterPayment(20, 0, 0, 0, 0);
System.out.print("Change: ");
System.out.println(register.giveChange());
The code segment prints the total as 0.07000000000000028. Explain why. Give a recommendation
to improve the code so that users will not be confused.

R4.7 Let n be an integer and x a floating-point number. Explain the difference between
n = (int) x;
and
n = (int) Math.round(x);
A:Same as R4.5

R4.8 Let n be an integer and x a floating-point number. Explain the difference between
n = (int) (x + 0.5);
and
n = (int) Math.round(x);
For what values of x do they give the same result? For what values of x do they give
different results?

R4.9 Consider the vending machine implementation in How To 4.1 on page 146. What
happens if the givePennyStamps method is invoked before the giveFirstClassStamps
method?
A:
giveFirstClassStamps -> buy stamps cost44 cents
givePennyStamps -> gives the change in penny (1-cent) stamps

R4.10 Explain the differences between 2, 2.0, '2', "2", and "2.0".

R4.11 Explain what each of the following two program segments computes:
int x = 2;
int y = x + x;
and
String s = "2";
String t = s + s;
A:Try it on Eclipse

R4.12 True or false? (x is an int and s is a String)
a. Integer.parseInt("" + x) is the same as x
b. "" + Integer.parseInt(s) is the same as s
c. s.substring(0, s.length()) is the same as s

R4.13 How do you get the first character of a string? The last character? How do you
remove the first character? The last character?

R4.14 How do you get the last digit of an integer? The first digit? That is, if n is 23456, how
do you find out that the first digit is 2 and the last digit is 6? Do not convert the
number to a string. Hint: %, Math.log.

R4.15 This chapter contains several recommendations regarding variables and constants
that make programs easier to read and maintain. Summarize these recommendations.
A:

R4.16 What is a final variable? Can you declare a final variable without supplying its
value? (Try it out.)

R4.17 What are the values of the following expressions? In each line, assume that
double x = 2.5;
double y = -1.5;
int m = 18;
int n = 4;
a. x + n * y - (x + n) * y
b. m / n + m % n
c. 5 * x - n / 5
d. Math.sqrt(Math.sqrt(n))
e. (int) Math.round(x)
f. (int) Math.round(x) + (int) Math.round(y)
g. 1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - n))))
A:
		double x = 2.5;
		double y = -1.5;
		int m = 18;
		int n = 4;
		System.out.println(x + n * y - (x + n) * y);
		System.out.println(m / n + m % n);
		System.out.println(5 * x - n / 5);
		System.out.println(Math.sqrt(Math.sqrt(n)));
		System.out.println((int) Math.round(x));
		System.out.println((int) Math.round(x) + (int) Math.round(y));
		System.out.println(1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - (1 - n)))));

R4.18 What are the values of the following expressions? In each line, assume that
int n = 4;
String s = "Hello";
String t = "World";
a. s + t
b. s + n
c. n + t
d. s.substring(1, n)
e. s.length() + t.length()
